### Quotes

- **ati sarvatra varjayet**
- The secret to high performance isn't rewards and punishments, but that unseen intrinsic drive- the drive to do things for their own sake. The drive to do things because they matter. - Dan Pink.
- One of the most powerful means of effecting change is when people can directly, tangibly and emotionally experience some of the future consequences of their actions today. - Anab Jain.

- Be who you are and say what you feel, because those who mind don't matter, and those who matter don't mind. - Bernard M. Baruch

- Hard work beats talent when talent doesn't work hard.
- A friendship founded on business is better than a business founded on friendship.
- Talent is God given. Be humble. Fame is man-given. Be grateful. Conceit is self-given. Be careful.
- Nothing changes if nothing changes.
- Not everyone has the same heart as you and not everyone is going to do what you have done for them. People will do what is best for them.

- No one cares about your story until you win, so win.

### Tweets

- "Anxiety is like having a frantic AI algorithm in your brain trying to predict patterns from the data of your entire life (including fiction & news you've consumed) and predicting all outcomes at the same time and you have to prepare for literally everything just in case." - @JoAnnaScience
- "If a system fails occasionally, you prepare for that. And if it never fails, that's great. In between is the problem, a system just reliable enough to lull you into complacency" - @JohnDCook
- "I think there are 3 kinds of ambition. The first kind is to seek external validation -- money & status. A higher kind is to seek impact & legacy. The highest kind is to seek answers. To seek to see clearly. What's really going on in this universe ? Ambition is a selfish thing." - @fchollet
